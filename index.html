      <div class="mt-3 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
        <p>Innocent Maduhu is a graduate of Georgia State University (GSU), where he earned a master’s in Actuarial Science (December 2024) and a master’s in Quantitative Risk Analysis and Management (May 2025). Prior to that, he received a bachelor’s degree in Actuarial Science from the University of Dar es Salaam (November 2015). Due to his outstanding performance, he was employed as a Tutorial Assistant at the same institution upon graduation. In this capacity, Innocent was responsible for preparing students’ assignments, tests, and quizzes; grading them; guiding students in their projects; and coordinating actuarial career events.</p>
        <p>In July 2016 (one year after starting this role), Innocent joined BSA Crescent Institute of Science & Technology (also known as Crescent College) to pursue his first master’s degree in Actuarial Science, which he completed with distinction in December 2018. He then returned to the University of Dar es Salaam to continue teaching undergraduate actuarial science students.</p>
        <p>In 2023, Innocent decided it was time to pursue his ultimate career goal as an actuary and enrolled in a dual master’s program at GSU in Atlanta, Georgia, USA. He aims to attain the ASA designation by mid-2026. During his internship with Reinsurance Group of America (RGA) at their global headquarters in Chesterfield, Missouri, he collaborated across underwriting and pricing teams and gained in-depth experience using Advanced Excel, VBA, and Power BI to analyze, automate, and present data effectively.</p>
